* Action Column
The Action column is a reserved column which contains action buttons for each row provided a by a dev

This makes the action column and rows not scrollable on x-axis

This helps to do general filtering in the table. This comes with both client and server

A cell in the table can have a customized css style (background, color, border style etc).

A cell behaves like a cell style but comes in small size like the text in the cell.
